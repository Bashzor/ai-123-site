          AI is moving fast — but your business doesn’t need hype. You need clear, safe, practical results.
          We focus on what actually helps businesses save time and reduce workload.

        <div class="grid-3">
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Plain-English guidance</h3>
            <p>No jargon, no buzzwords. We explain what AI can do, what it can’t do, and what’s worth paying for.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Built for businesses</h3>
            <p>We design AI workflows for real teams — offices, shops, service businesses — not enterprise IT departments.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Safety-first approach</h3>
            <p>We teach simple rules so employees don’t accidentally share private customer data or company info.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Training your team, not replacing them</h3>
            <p>AI should make your staff faster and more confident — not create risk or confusion.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Tool-agnostic</h3>
            <p>We don’t “push” one vendor. We help you choose what fits your business (Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity).</p>
          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Honest recommendations</h3>
            <p>If AI isn’t worth it for your business yet, we’ll tell you. No pressure and no long contracts.</p>
